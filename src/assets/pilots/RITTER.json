By the time of his birth, the planet had long since stabilized into a quiet, self-sufficient society shaped by tradition, local governance, and limited offworld involvement. Life there was orderly and predictable, and most residents remained within their communities for generations. </p><p>Alaric left as soon as he was able. Rather than pursuing a civilian trade, he enlisted with a locally operating free company that provided mechanized security and military support within the system. The company’s work was limited in scope and scale: border disputes between regional authorities, protection of infrastructure, and suppression of low-intensity armed conflict. Over several years, Alaric participated in a number of small campaigns and skirmishes, all confined to the surface of New Baden-Württemberg.</p><p>During this period, Alaric was taken on as a squire by a veteran pilot within the company. Under this mentorship, he developed a reputation for reliability and discipline. He was noted for maintaining cohesion under pressure, adhering closely to orders, and prioritizing the safety of his unit over individual initiative. His approach favored steady positioning and defensive action rather than aggressive maneuvering. </p><p>When hostilities on the planet diminished and contracts became scarce, the free company reduced its operations. Around this time, Union representatives conducting routine reviews of regional security forces identified several candidates for recruitment. Alaric was among those selected and accepted into Union service. </p><p>His transition into Union training was uneventful. While his background differed from that of academy-trained pilots, his prior experience translated cleanly into Union doctrine. He completed the required instruction and certification, qualifying as a mechanized chassis pilot under Union command. Following graduation, Alaric was assigned to the UNS-CV Rio Grande, an Ebro-class light carrier attached to a diplomatic mission to the planet Cressidium. The posting marked his first active deployment as a Union lancer.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":10,"background":"Company Squire","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"1d2b44e3-f6b4-47f8-aa36-1d105cbcf84c","name":"Sturmbrecher","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_sagarmatha","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":17,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":5,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Thu Jan 08 2026 12:09:20 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"7c39c0b4-e126-4ba3-a212-de1b8f23af37","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"bns_blade_guard","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"<div>Armory manufactured blades and axes are built to the highest standard of durability.
