He showed an early aptitude for code, slipping past parental locks and habitat firewalls before he was old enough to legally own a terminal. By his late teens, Hal had abandoned legitimate work entirely, surviving instead as a high-end freelance hacker, specializing in data extraction, system intrusion, and digital counterintelligence.</p><p>His alias on the mesh was THOTH, named after an ancient Terran god of knowledge, writing, and secrets. Under that name, Hal became known for impossible jobs: ghosting corporate AIs without triggering alarms, extracting sealed data from hardened black boxes, and rewriting reality in bureaucratic systems so cleanly that no one realized anything had changed. He didn’t just steal information—he curated it.</p><p>That reputation eventually drew attention from the wrong people.</p><p>During what was supposed to be a routine contract, Hal uncovered evidence of a covert operation tied to an extra-legal paramilitary group operating under the cover of a Union-adjacent contractor. The data wasn’t just valuable—it was dangerous, implicating powerful interests in violations of the First Contact Accords and colonial autonomy laws. When Hal tried to sell the data, the buyers didn’t negotiate.</p><p>They hunted him.<br><br>Hal survived only because Union Intelligence found him first.</p><p>Rather than disappear him—or recruit him quietly—Union made an offer: full amnesty, citizenship upgrades, and Lancer training in exchange for service. Union didn’t need another soldier; they needed someone who understood systems from the inside out, someone who could fight wars that didn’t always involve bullets.</p><p>Hal accepted.</p><p>Lancer training was brutal, disorienting, and nothing like the quiet certainty of code. But Hal adapted. Where others learned battlefield tactics, he learned to read the war itself—electronic warfare, NHP behavior patterns, mech telemetry, and enemy command structures. In the cockpit, Hal’s mind treated combat like a living network, every hostile unit a node waiting to be exploited.</p><p>He kept the callsign THOTH.</p><p>Now deployed as a Union Lancer, Hal McFann walks a thin line between idealism and cynicism. He believes in Union’s principles—but never forgets how easily systems lie. He follows orders, but always reads between the lines. Somewhere out there are people who still want him erased, and secrets he never fully sold.</p><p>If war is information, then Thoth intends to control the narrative.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":7,"background":"Hacker","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"450b2182-01bd-466e-97e1-972b4904347d","name":"When In Doubt","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_chomolungma","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":13,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":4,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Wed Jan 07 2026 13:50:21 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"fcf4b809-363f-4d93-ac96-b360f8956c66","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_custom_paint_job","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_manipulators","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Precise interaction with built and natural environments, soft targets, and hazardous materials is part of the daily routine for support-class mechs.
