He attended military college, where he received the training required to pilot one of the prestigious Shermans relied upon by the HA Legions. He took part in peacekeeping operations along the Dawnline Shore against Karakin forces, participated in naval raids against pirate barons, and even attended a military parade for Harrison III himself.</p><p>But it wasn’t enough. Marv felt there was more he could do outside of the Legion. He approached his officer and requested a different job assignment—one with more action. The officer offered him a position with an associate within Union, attached to a peacekeeping operation on a highly unstable world. Marv eagerly accepted, ready to spread the good word of Harrison in Union space. Sure he would loose the licence requirement to pilot his sherman, but he felt eager to work his way back up and get it all again.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":10,"background":"Soldier","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"023aab84-ef2e-478e-bf7f-24279aed8750","name":"Golden Hero","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":13,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":5,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Wed Jan 07 2026 17:43:45 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"","loadouts":[{"id":"baae52d2-e196-40e2-b1b7-514815506693","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_custom_paint_job","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_armament_redundancy","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"By installing additional armor plating, redundant firing circuits, and enhanced insulation to magazines the longevity of a frame’s armaments can be greatly enhanced."},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_pattern_a_jericho_deployable_cover","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_expanded_compartment","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_manipulators","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Precise interaction with built and natural environments, soft targets, and hazardous materials is part of the daily routine for support-class mechs.
