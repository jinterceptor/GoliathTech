SIX MONTHS OUT
DEEP SPACE

The trip to Cressidium takes just under six months subjective time—long enough for routines to settle in, and for novelty to wear thin.


## How You Pass The Time

Pilots are expected to remain combat-ready, but boredom is the real enemy out here. Over the months, you’ve likely done some combination of:

Simulator Training
Repeated mech drills, wargames, and scenario sims—urban combat, escort duty, reactor failure response. You’re good on paper now. Whether that translates under fire remains to be seen.

Physical Conditioning & Sparring
The ship’s gyms are always busy. Marines and pilots alike blow off steam in sparring cages, zero-G movement drills, or endurance tests designed to remind everyone that mechs aren’t the only things that need maintenance.

Shipboard Games & Traditions
Card games, board games, omninet media, and long-running rivalries. Kapkat tournaments. Betting pools on simulator scores. Arguments about whose academy trained “real” pilots.

Socializing (or Not)
Some people thrive in the closed ecosystem of a ship. Others retreat into routine, isolation, or obsessive hobbies. Over six months, reputations form—even among people who don’t want them.

## The Ship: UNS-CV Rio Grande

**Class:** Ebro-class light carrier

**Role:** Designed for escort, patrol, and rapid response

Smaller than a fleet carrier, faster and more flexible

## Layout (What You’d Know)

**Flight Decks & Hangars**
Multiple bays capable of handling fighters, dropships, and mounted chassis. This is where pilots spend much of their active duty—prepping, maintaining, or just loitering.

**Command & CIC**
The ship’s nerve center. Tactically dense, tightly controlled, and usually off-limits unless you have business there.

**Crew Quarters**
Compact but functional. Pilots rate better accommodations than most enlisted crew, though “spacious” is relative.

**Training & Recreation**
Gyms, simulators, mess areas, and a handful of common rooms that develop their own micro-cultures over long patrols.

**Engineering & Maintenance**
Loud, hot, and perpetually busy. You don’t go here unless something is wrong—or you know exactly what you’re doing.

## Armaments & Defenses

The Rio Grande is lightly armed by naval standards.

Point-Defense Cannons for intercepting missiles and small craft

Electronic Countermeasures and defensive systems

Strike Craft Wings as its primary offensive capability

It is not equipped for sustained orbital bombardment, and it is not intended to act independently against capital ships.

## Personnel You Know

By now, certain figures are familiar:

**Captain Brigid Farris**

Calm, professional, and visibly protective of her crew. She treats this mission seriously, even if she doesn’t expect trouble.

**1st Lieutenant Alex Kim**

The XO. Efficient, by-the-book, and visibly eager to prove himself. He runs drills hard and rarely wastes words.

**Staff Sergeant Omari Garcia**

Marine lifer. Loud, capable, and relentlessly sarcastic about pilots and their “fancy suits,” though he’d bleed for any of you without hesitation.

**Ambassador Nilan Bannerjee**

Present aboard ship intermittently. Polite, composed, and disarmingly personable. They seem genuinely optimistic about Cressidium.

**Rio (Shipboard NHP)**

Ever-present, friendly, and unsettlingly competent. During drills she’s all business; off duty she chats like she’s just another crewmate.

**Kayla "Glamdring" Rowley**

Friendly and self-assured. Glamdring is always happy to make small talk over a drink or a game of poker—though her miserable poker face is infamous.
