## THE DROP

*“Diplomacy is just war conducted with better manners.”*  


# Goals

- Deploy planetside as part of a Union security detail.
- Rendezvous 'in uniform' with *Captain Brigid Farris* and *Ambassador Nilan Bannerjee.*
- Establish a visible Union presence at FOB Saber.

# Stakes

- Stability of ongoing negotiations between the Leandric States Alliance and the Vestan Sovereignty
- Union’s diplomatic credibility on Cressidium
- Your squad’s reputation during its first live deployment

# Mission Briefing

Negotiations between the Leandric States Alliance (LSA) and the Vestan Sovereignty have reached a standstill during the height of the summer solstice. Talks have not broken down, but progress has slowed, and tensions between the two powers remain evident.

Union intelligence indicates internal unrest within the Vestan Sovereignty, contributing to increasingly strained relations with the LSA. While some analysts are concerned about possible escalation, Ambassador Bannerjee remains confident that negotiations will stabilize with continued Union mediation.

Out of an abundance of caution, Captain Farris has elected to assign a Union honor guard to accompany the ambassador during planetside movements. You have been selected for this role.

1st Lieutenant Alex Kim advises that expectations for the deployment are minimal: extended periods of standing by, ceremonial presence, and routine security oversight. That said, pilots are instructed to deploy with standard combat loadouts in the event the situation deteriorates unexpectedly.

Staff Sergeant Omari Garcia and his marine detachment will deploy separately and are expected to establish their own security footprint in the area.

As part of standard operating procedure, one pilot in the squad will be issued an Omnihook to maintain secure omninet communication with the UNS-CV Rio Grande during the operation.

> Cressidium is a Cradle-type world located along the Cascade Line, long believed lost following the collapse of Union’s Second Committee. Settled in secrecy by political and military elites fleeing the revolutionary period, the planet was deliberately erased from Union records and developed in isolation for over five centuries.

> During that time, Cressidium formed several powerful nation-states, developed advanced conventional industry, and fielded its own mechanized chassis designs. While its overall technological level broadly matches modern Union standards, the planet notably lacks widespread access to omninet infrastructure, modern printer networks, and advanced paracausal research.

> Recent recontact has revealed a populous, divided world—one shaped as much by the legacy of Second Committee ideology as by centuries of independence. Union’s presence marks the first step toward reintegration, but also the reopening of old histories many would prefer remain buried.
